   <p> Any and all text alternatives for anyone who cant neccessarily read or
     understand what it would normally say.


     <p> 1.2 is about video alternatives for anyone who could
                be blind

                <p> 1.3 is about presenting content in different ways
                  to be simpler


                     <p> I believe 1.4 is about distiguishing text/audio to
                       be easier to see/hear
